# VicNotes Remake

## The ideia of this project is to make a remake of VicNotes, a note taking app that I made on university.

## Technological stack that I will use are:
- Quick AI programming technique from Felipe Forbeck
- PostgreSQL for registering the users
- AWS S3 for storing the notes context
- Node.js for the backend
- Vue.js for the frontend
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Redis for caching
- Docker for containerization
- Nginx for reverse proxy
- Figma for the UI/UX design
- GitHub for version control
- GitHub Actions to CI/CD
- AWS EC2 for the server
- Cloudflare for WAF
- Porkbun for domain ownership

## This project will have two versions. The first one for a single server that'll run and allow everyone to use it. And the second one, which will be microsservice based so I can scale it on future
