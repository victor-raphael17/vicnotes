# VicNotes Remake

## The ideia of this project is to make a remake of VicNotes, a note taking app that I made on university.

## The tech stack will vary based on the version of the project. There will be a version for running it locally, a cloud version to run with low traffic and another cloud version to run with high traffic.

### Cloud version tech stack:
- Quick AI programming technique from Felipe Forbeck
- Vue.js for the frontend
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Nginx for reverse proxy
- PostgreSQL for registering the users
- Go for the backend
- AWS S3 for storing the notes context
- Redis for caching
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub for version control
- GitHub Actions to CI/CD
- AWS EC2 for the server
- Cloudflare for WAF
- Porkbun for domain ownership

## Configuration for devs
1. Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
    - Docker and Docker Compose
2. Run the config.sh
